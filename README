A jest test enabled typescript template.

It's for lazy guy who just want a typescript project with jest test framework setup and ready to use.
Search internet for a good solution isn't that productive. 

install:
  1. clone this repo
  2. npm i -D jest typescript
  3. npm i -D ts-jest @types/jest
  
  and all should be done
  
  if there is a problem, please file it in issues list. 
  
DISCLAIM:
I've only test it with VS Code(Community version), but this should work with other work environment.
